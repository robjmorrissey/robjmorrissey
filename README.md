### Hey there, I'm Rob ðŸ‘‹

I'm 20 years old and a co-founder & developer @ [Hop](https://hop.io) - a cloud platform for building and deploying realtime apps

## ðŸŒ± Experience
I'm primarily a backend engineer building realtime services/APIs and bridging them to the client through React. 

My Stack

- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) - Primarily used for developing socket services, APIs and distribution at scale.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Used for developing UI.
- [TypeScript/Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Used for developing misc services that don't need to be in Elixir.
